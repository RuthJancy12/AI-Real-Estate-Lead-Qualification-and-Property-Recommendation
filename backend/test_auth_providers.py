"""Firebase account/provider integrity test (live read-only lookup).

Verifies the load-bearing invariants behind LYKA sign-in and role
resolution, without passwords, tokens, or secrets:
  1. Every staff email maps to exactly one Firebase UID (no duplicates
     across staff accounts — duplicates would demote users to "customer").
  2. Every staff Firebase account is enabled (disabled accounts fail all
     sign-in methods, including Google).
  3. Every provider linked to a staff account is from the known set
     {google.com, password} — an unexpected provider blocks diagnosis.
  4. Each backend staff_users.firebase_uid binding (when set) equals the
     live Firebase UID for that email, so linking a password later (same
     UID) preserves roles, assignments, and permissions.

Deliberately does NOT assert password presence: linking a password is the
supported remedy for Google-only accounts, and must not break this suite.

Skips cleanly (exit 0) when the service account or network is unavailable.

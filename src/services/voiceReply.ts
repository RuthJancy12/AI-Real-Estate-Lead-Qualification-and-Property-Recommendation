 * LYKA Realty — optional AI voice replies via the browser's built-in

 * vendor: everything runs on-device in the browser.
 *
 * Contract (mirrors the dictation side):
 * - OFF by default; the user opts in with the Voice Reply toggle.
 * - Only FINAL assistant replies are spoken, exactly once each (tracked
 *   by message id — streamed token appends never retrigger speech).
 * - Enabling never replays history; only replies created while ON speak.
 * - Disabling, closing the chat, or sending a new message stops speech
 *   immediately (no overlap, no orphaned audio).
